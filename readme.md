# oze-canopen-viewer
Real-time CanOpen traffic sniffer for Linux with a low latency graphical interface and convenient filters. Compatible only with socket CAN drivers.

![](doc/screenshot.png)

# Features:
- Automatic interface configuration when connecting USB-CAN with bitrate configuration.
- CAN bus load graph.
- Parsing and displaying the packet type and corresponding nodeID.
- Global filter by packet types, regex for COB-ID and DATA, and nodeID filter.
- Ability to pin a filter, displaying only the latest message and the time delta between messages. This is useful for convenient PDO tracking.
- Instant switching between data representations: HEX, BIN, ASCII.
- FPS limited only by the hardware (tested with 300 FPS).

# Documentation

[Documentation](doc/description.md) is in `doc/description.md` or `doc/description_ru.md`

# Alternatives
- Wireshark: Formally has all the needed features, but its focus on dump analysis rather than real-time makes it inconvenient for real-time work, e.g., when you need to monitor the contents of packets on two COB-IDs simultaneously.
- [candump](https://github.com/cantools/cantools): A console utility that does not parse CanOpen messages. It has various filters for data and COB-ID, but is not very convenient to use.
- [CanOpenMonitor](https://github.com/robincornelius/CanOpenMonitor): Has no realtime filters over message data.
- Proprietary and paid: `CANopen Magic`, `PCAN-View`

# Build

If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 then you can download precompiled `.deb` file from the releases tab, install it, and use it.

Or build it yourself:

1. Build the application:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
2. Add access to manage the interface:
```sh
sudo setcap cap_NET_ADMIN=ep ./target/release/oze-canopen-viewer
```
3. Launch:
```sh
./target/release/oze-canopen-viewer
```
4. Enter the `can name` and `bitrate` if needed, then click `Connect`.

You can also run it without setcap. To do this, start the program, enter the interface name, click `Connect`, and then execute:
```sh
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 100000
sudo ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

You can hover element and get documentation.

# Testing
Unit tests are in `src/` and has no external requirements, you can run it using `cargo test`. Gui code doesn't have automated testing.

Integration tests are in `tests/`. To run it successfully you need:
1. Create virtual CAN interface:
- `sudo modprobe vcan`
- `sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan`
- `sudo ip link set up vcan0`
2. Run `cargo test -- --test-threads 1`

After that you can check code coverage using `cargo tarpaulin -j 1 --engine llvm`
